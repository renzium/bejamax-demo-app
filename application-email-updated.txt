Subject: Frontend Developer Application - Parallax Carousel Demo Ready

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Frontend Developer and Designer position. I understand the critical importance of the parallax scrolling carousel as the core differentiator of your platform, and I have prepared a working demo that demonstrates my ability to execute this requirement precisely.

Parallax Carousel Demo - Live and Ready for Review

I have created a clean, working demonstration of the vertical scroll parallax carousel with the exact layer speeds you specified:
- Cars and trucks: 0.5x
- Buildings: 1.0x (normal scroll)
- Airplane: 0.5x
- Background skyline: 0.3x

Live Demo: https://parallax-carousel-demo.vercel.app/
GitHub Repository: https://github.com/renzium/parallax-carousel-demo

The demo is built with React/Next.js, uses CSS3 transforms for smooth performance, and follows your design philosophy: clean, simple, and readable with the parallax effect as the focus—no heavy animations. It's deployed on Vercel and ready for immediate review.

Technical Alignment

I have extensive experience with your preferred tech stack:
- Frontend: React.js, Next.js, Vue.js, TypeScript, CSS3 with Flexbox/Grid
- Routing: React Router, Vue Router
- State Management: React Context API, Vuex
- Backend: Node.js with Express, PostgreSQL, AWS S3
- Integrations: Stripe payments, QR code generation (qrcode.js), image upload handling

Project Approach

I understand the tight timeline (MVP launch target: January 17) and the need for:
- Fast iteration and clear communication
- Responsiveness and reliability
- Long-term collaboration potential
- First-week deliverable: parallax carousel + landing page

The compensation range ($10–$15/hour) and project scope (100–135 hours) work well for me. I am available for a short video call to discuss the project further and walk through the live demo.

Additional Information

- Resume/CV: My detailed CV is attached, which includes this Parallax Carousel Demo project in the Key Projects section, along with other relevant frontend development experience.

- Code Quality: The GitHub repository is open for review, showcasing clean component architecture, TypeScript implementation, and production-ready code.

I am ready to move quickly and would appreciate the opportunity to show you the working demo. I believe my experience with modern frontend development, attention to visual detail, and ability to work under tight deadlines make me a strong fit for this role.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to hearing from you.
